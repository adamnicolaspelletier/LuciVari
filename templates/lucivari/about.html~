        		The LuciVari Web App has been put together by Adam Pelletier <Br><br>
           
            The aim of the app is to allow easy visualization for a large scale luciferase assay project, accross, hundreds at Single Nucleotide Variants, dozens 
            of transcription factors and multiple cell lines. <br><br>
            
            While everyone can look at placeholder results for showcasing purposes, only registered users will be able to see the final result, or add experimental data.
            <br><br>
				The application also includes a data transformation tool for easy daat analysis and consolidation following each experiment, to streamline addition of novel data in an automated manner.
